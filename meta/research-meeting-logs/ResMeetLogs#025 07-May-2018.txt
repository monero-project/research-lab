[2018-05-07 10:02:40] <sarang> I suppose we can discuss recent updates and such
[2018-05-07 10:02:51] <sarang> I have been focusing on noninteractive refund transactions
[2018-05-07 10:02:58] <sarang> it's surprisingly tricky to get right
[2018-05-07 10:03:34] <sarang> The idea of whether or not to hide block heights has big implications on size and complexity
[2018-05-07 10:03:52] <sarang> and also will affect the use of old outputs

[2018-05-07 10:04:33] <sarang> A good higher-level question is whether we insist that having refund transactions is enough of a priority

[2018-05-07 10:06:45] <sarang> theRealSurae: what has consumed you lately?
[2018-05-07 10:07:11] <UkoeHB> it feels like there should be an easier way to hide amounts. Maybe worth mulling for some time
[2018-05-07 10:07:22] <sarang> UkoeHB: other than commitments?
[2018-05-07 10:07:51] <rehrar[m]> Hi
[2018-05-07 10:07:51] <UkoeHB> Yeah. Maybe a shift in perspective. Baseless intuition
[2018-05-07 10:07:59] <silur> what
[2018-05-07 10:08:18] <sarang> Well, the current Best Way is homomorphic commitments + range proofs to ensure balance
[2018-05-07 10:08:18] <theRealSurae> I've been thinking about koe's reduced mlsag and how we might be able to batch-verify ring signatures with bulletproofs. and i've been speaking with a professor at clemson university about the possibility of starting a paid project for a grad student to invent a new elliptic curve with 2^255-19 points on it, or to come up with a similar sort of variant to secp256k1
[2018-05-07 10:09:00] <theRealSurae> yeah, I think we are going to experience reduced returns in terms of hammering bulletproofs for improving our amount strucutres
[2018-05-07 10:09:03] <sarang> theRealSurae: BPs to batch verify our current MLSAG scheme?

[2018-05-07 10:11:32] <sarang> What are your thoughts on refunds?
[2018-05-07 10:11:32] <UkoeHB> and thank you for that :) incredibly helpful
[2018-05-07 10:11:45] <sarang> UkoeHB: any big changes to your excellent paper?
[2018-05-07 10:12:27] <UkoeHB> Well we found out monero doesn't even use borromean sigs
[2018-05-07 10:12:55] <UkoeHB> genBorromean should be genSAGs
[2018-05-07 10:13:03] <UkoeHB> Or something
[2018-05-07 10:13:11] <sarang> SAG?
[2018-05-07 10:13:12] <theRealSurae> I've been thinking a lot about the refund structure with timelocks, and I'm trying to figure out exactly whether we have a novel "invention" in these refund transactions or whether tit is equivalent to a timelock+multisig situation

[2018-05-07 10:14:59] <theRealSurae> ... i need more details about that, koe, if you don't mind...
[2018-05-07 10:15:11] <sarang> heh

[2018-05-07 10:16:11] <theRealSurae> I want to remind everyone that I'll be mostly away from the internet from tomorrow until the 19th, with some intermittent access.
[2018-05-07 10:16:18] <moneromooo> luigi1111: is this (genBorromean doesn't actually generate Borromean sigs) correct ?

[2018-05-07 10:17:41] <theRealSurae> i'm not the sort who can really put work down, but i'm trying, briefly. i managed to write up a skeleton of the unforgeability proof for multisig and hand it off to sarang to familiarize himself with the musig approach
[2018-05-07 10:17:58] <binaryFate> Zcash is also coming up with their own curve so as to speed up the particular things they need to. I find it worrying if the trend is that every project cooks up their curve to suit their particular needs.
[2018-05-07 10:17:59] <theRealSurae> and, like I said, I'm communicating with some folks at Clemson
[2018-05-07 10:18:02] <sarang> Yeah I've been revisiting the original musig paper
[2018-05-07 10:18:02] <luigi1111> Not that I know of
[2018-05-07 10:18:09] <theRealSurae> binaryFate: why would this be worrying?
[2018-05-07 10:18:31] <luigi1111> theRealSurae: 2^255-19 isn't the number of points
[2018-05-07 10:18:48] <theRealSurae> you are right, it's the group order
[2018-05-07 10:18:50] <binaryFate> against the "don't invent your own crypto", and light years away from typical review process for curves
[2018-05-07 10:18:57] <theRealSurae> right? i misspoke
[2018-05-07 10:19:08] <vtnerd> no, 2^255-19 is the prime field
[2018-05-07 10:20:09] <sarang> I hear it's a kind of cake
[2018-05-07 10:20:27] <sarang> Or that feeling when your leg falls asleep and you stand up
[2018-05-07 10:20:32] <luigi1111> Group order is l

[2018-05-07 10:22:45] <sarang> aaaanyway
[2018-05-07 10:22:50] <theRealSurae> i confess I tend to think of our group as a scrambled mirror image of Z_q, despite addition of points not even landing on the subgroup.
[2018-05-07 10:22:58] <sarang> So theRealSurae is working on unforgeability
[2018-05-07 10:23:16] <sarang> I am figuring out if noninteractive new-output-style refunds are worth it
[2018-05-07 10:23:20] <sarang> Other fun times?
[2018-05-07 10:24:10] <theRealSurae> binaryFate: yeah, I see that
[2018-05-07 10:24:41] <sarang> binaryFate: do you have any information on the Zcash efforts? I wasn't aware of their work
[2018-05-07 10:25:13] <theRealSurae> binaryFate: eventually that curve, even if proven to satisfy our desired properties, will have to be implemented, and the dangers or crappy implementation are huge... but I don't think that should discourage research into new curves and new proof methods using isomorphic curves
[2018-05-07 10:25:37] <theRealSurae> yeah, I wasn't either. I thought it was just Blockstream looking for a variant of secp256k1 so far
[2018-05-07 10:25:56] <UkoeHB> oh i messed up - they are borromean ugh
[2018-05-07 10:26:08] <theRealSurae> that's a relief koe!
[2018-05-07 10:26:11] <sarang> UkoeHB: what led to believe otherwise?

[2018-05-07 10:33:10] <theRealSurae> sneurlax: that's fantastic news
[2018-05-07 10:33:16] <rehrar[m]> ZCash wants to open a grant proposal jointly with a Monero community member (that'd be me atm) to donate a considerable sum of money to some FFS proposals.

[2018-05-07 10:33:41] <theRealSurae> how would that work? would you have discretion over donating the funds?

[2018-05-07 10:35:16] <rehrar[m]> We can out it up, raise the amount, and take out right away. Superior Coin also wants to help if you recall.
[2018-05-07 10:35:41] <rehrar[m]> Perhaps we can also get subaddresses audited?
[2018-05-07 10:35:43] <theRealSurae> hmm
[2018-05-07 10:35:46] <sarang> Yeah, was thinking of waiting until closer to the finalization, but I suppose there's little advantage if we can coordinate w/ OSTIF quickly
[2018-05-07 10:35:52] <theRealSurae> it seems like a lot of projects want to funnel their research funding through the Monero FFS
[2018-05-07 10:36:23] <binaryFate> the harder we criticize them the more they like us... 10k$ is not that much compared to amounts raised typically anyway
[2018-05-07 10:36:42] <sarang> It's a nice gesture of community spirit though
[2018-05-07 10:36:49] <sgp_[m]> I think the best ones are the hardware wallet (which should work with Zcash iirc) and code audits
[2018-05-07 10:37:09] <rehrar[m]> They're masochists binaryfate. If we criticize harder they'll give more.
[2018-05-07 10:37:18] <sarang> A subaddress audit depends highly on the scope
[2018-05-07 10:37:29] <sarang> The BP scope was narrow-ish
[2018-05-07 10:37:35] <theRealSurae> binaryFate: yeah, it seems like a largely symbolic thing, but also: they've been really encouraging me and sarang to encourage you guys to ask for grant money.

[2018-05-07 10:42:42] <theRealSurae> What if we take the 10k, pay for a semester of a grad student working with some cryptographers to invent three new curves, a variant for secp256k1, a variant for x25519, and a variant for zcash's thing

[2018-05-07 10:43:24] <endogenic> sorry rehar
[2018-05-07 10:43:36] <theRealSurae> it'd guarantee that student would spend the rest of his time in grad school working on that sort of thing
[2018-05-07 10:43:57] <theRealSurae> which I think would be a valuable thing: seed the mind-virus among as many researchers as possible
[2018-05-07 10:44:11] <binaryFate> They're not even asking for doing joint work with zcash stuff at this stage apparently. Would just channel to Monero topics entirely if possible.

[2018-05-07 10:44:34] <rehrar[m]> I'll talk with Miller.
[2018-05-07 10:44:36] <rehrar[m]> See how he wants to do the grant proposal.
[2018-05-07 10:44:41] <theRealSurae> binaryFate: the problem then is picking the student/school
[2018-05-07 10:44:56] <pwrcycle> Funding grant money for school research seems cool. Pinning all the hopes on one grad student seems like a bad idea.
[2018-05-07 10:44:58] <theRealSurae> rehrar[m]: please do, maybe CC me... I can hook him up with at least two cryptographers at Clemson who may be interested
[2018-05-07 10:45:15] <theRealSurae> pwrcycle: yeah, you'd pick by advisor more than student
[2018-05-07 10:46:05] <rehrar[m]> Maybe we can get some people to make a FFS that should have made one a while back in exchange for ZCash paper
[2018-05-07 10:46:18] <rehrar[m]> Like dEBRYUNE

[2018-05-07 10:46:37] <binaryFate> Btw having some sort of pulic call for the paid internship circulating in academic circles is as important as the thing actually happening, in terms of mind-virus spreading

[2018-05-07 10:49:29] <theRealSurae> so it's sort of both pure and applied
[2018-05-07 10:49:30] <theRealSurae> oh ok
[2018-05-07 10:49:32] <sarang> I mean to get solid reach to academics
[2018-05-07 10:49:37] <sarang> that's the obvious choice
[2018-05-07 10:49:38] <theRealSurae> yep
[2018-05-07 10:50:20] <sarang> They can send us a list of all the points on their new curve, for us to check
[2018-05-07 10:50:29] <binaryFate> good old emails circulating between labs and advisors ("if you have a really good students, consider asking them to apply. And please forward blabla") is also worth it. Reaches more senior people than a job posting probably read primarily by students directly.
[2018-05-07 10:51:30] <sarang> Oh, so I've been seeing random reddit postings about deep reorgs
[2018-05-07 10:51:35] <sarang> But I haven't looked into it at all
[2018-05-07 10:51:38] <sarang> Anyone know anything?
[2018-05-07 10:52:08] <selsta> also articles are starting to come out https://www.trustnodes.com/2018/05/07/monero-allegedly-attack-claims-double-spends-orphaned-chains-21-block-deep

[2018-05-07 10:52:31] <moneromooo> I think it's fixed now (no PR yet).
[2018-05-07 10:52:38] <sarang> Do you know the cause?
[2018-05-07 10:52:40] <theRealSurae> is it known what the issue was?
[2018-05-07 10:52:46] <sarang> jinx
[2018-05-07 10:52:49] <binaryFate> The +20-blocks fork mentioned in the post is not an actual fork, you only see that when syncing. But somebody is fiddling with decent HR
[2018-05-07 10:52:51] <sarang> buy me a DietMonero
[2018-05-07 10:52:52] <theRealSurae> i thought the first few reports were possibly the OP for some reason
[2018-05-07 10:53:03] <binaryFate> moneromooo link or summary?

[2018-05-07 10:53:29] <moneromooo> Some init wasn't done in some cases when adding a tx.
[2018-05-07 10:53:30] <sarang> Yeah, I want to be able to give correct information
[2018-05-07 10:53:55] <moneromooo> So that was causing the tx to be rejected though it is valid.
[2018-05-07 10:54:21] <theRealSurae> hrmm
[2018-05-07 10:54:21] <sarang> OK, so that explains the "double spend" FUD
[2018-05-07 10:54:36] <sarang> The long-chain reorgs are just related to initial sync?
[2018-05-07 10:57:10] <sarang> It was noted that there wasn't any big spike in hashrate
[2018-05-07 10:57:18] <sarang> so it's not outsiders coming online and futzing
[2018-05-07 10:58:06] <moneromooo> If a pool doesn't accept a valid tx, it will continue mining on its own chain till it stops doing so.
[2018-05-07 10:58:30] <sarang> OK, so it's a single cause with these two effects?
[2018-05-07 10:58:56] <moneromooo> What two effects ?
[2018-05-07 10:59:25] <sarang> Well the reports I've seen have complained about apparent double spends (rejected tx) and long-chain reorgs
[2018-05-07 10:59:41] <theRealSurae> i feel like if a selfish miner was going to release a chain in an attack, the hashrate wouldn't necessarily look different to an observer, especially if the attacker had 33%+ attack power and was clever with their timestamp choice...
[2018-05-07 11:00:00] <moneromooo> I don't know anything about double spends.
[2018-05-07 11:00:23] <moneromooo> Though if a merchant is only connected to that pool, you could swindle it.
[2018-05-07 11:00:43] <moneromooo> The merchant would have to be only connected to that pool though, but that's not a new attack.
[2018-05-07 11:01:04] <sarang> Yeah that's just being cavalier
[2018-05-07 11:01:04] <theRealSurae> https://www.trustnodes.com/2018/05/07/monero-allegedly-attack-claims-double-spends-orphaned-chains-21-block-deep
[2018-05-07 11:01:12] <theRealSurae> i don't like that article for a variety of reasons, but
[2018-05-07 11:01:14] <sarang> Yeah that's the article I keep getting linked to
[2018-05-07 11:01:23] <sarang> it's based on some r/monero complaint posts

[2018-05-07 11:01:38] <sarang> so naturally it will be accepted as gospel and spread widely
[2018-05-07 11:01:59] <theRealSurae> it would be helpful to get more information from the specific users making this complaint
[2018-05-07 11:02:00] <sarang> A random user says one thing and the devs who know things say another thing! So there's no way to know!
[2018-05-07 11:02:32] <binaryFate> <sarang> It was noted that there wasn't any big spike in hashrate <-- if someone is purposefully mining on alternative blocks rather than winning chain, we would not "see" the HR spike as it does not make blocks coming faster
[2018-05-07 11:02:58] <moneromooo> You'd see a hashrate spike downwards.
[2018-05-07 11:03:25] <binaryFate> only if that miner was mining before no?
[2018-05-07 11:03:33] <moneromooo> Yes.
[2018-05-07 11:04:07] <theRealSurae> not necessarily; an attacker with exactly 50% hash rate and honest timestamps will appear to be invisible. an attacker with lower hash rate could mess with timestamps slightly and appear invisible. an attacker with too low of a hash rate couldn't manipulate his timestamps enough to hide his activity
[2018-05-07 11:04:27] <theRealSurae> (not necessarily re: downward spike)
[2018-05-07 11:04:53] <binaryFate> Can we check how long it took them to mine a particular altchain of N blocks by checking logs on other nodes on when the last block in their chain got known to peers?
[2018-05-07 11:08:03] <theRealSurae> we can put a bound on it, for sure, and we can use that to estimate the hash rate power they have
[2018-05-07 11:08:11] <theRealSurae> ok y'all I gotta go
[2018-05-07 11:08:19] <theRealSurae> have a good week and a half!
