# Research Meeting Logs

## Format:

### File name:
`ResMeetLogs#xxx dd-mo.-yyyy.txt`, where xxxx is the meeting number (chronological order) and the month is represented in abbreviated form.
Ex. `ResMeetLogs#059 28-Jan-2019.txt`

### Log lines:
[yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss] <alias> message, where hh is based on the 24-hour clock in UTC time.
Ex. `[2019-01-28 12:01:09] <ArticMine> hi`



Note: not all discussion is captured within the meeting logs, and meetings with undefined endings were cut off arbitrarily.
