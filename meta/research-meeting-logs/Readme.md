#Research Meeting Logs

##Format:
`#ResMeetLogs-xxxx-dd-mo.-yyyy.txt`, where xxxx is the meeting number (chronological order) and the month is represented in abbreviated form.

Note: not all discussion is captured within the meeting logs, and meetings without defined endings were cut off somewhat arbitrarily.
